	<h1>Existence SMP</h1>

	<p>
		Welcome to the Existence SMP Community! We're an Online Minecraft Community group established in
		March 2016.
	</p>

	<p>
		Over the past few years we've had 3 primary YouTube based series and are now focusing on
		creating a more open Minecraft community with our <a class="anchor" href="/">
			Community Server
		</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Community Server</h2>

	<p>
		The Community Server is our whitelisted SMP for Patrons and Trusted members of the Existence
		community.
	</p>

	<p>
		Leading on from the sucsess of <a class="anchor" href="/server/keystone">Project Keystone</a>,
		the server is the home of Existence SMP for our new community-focused era.
	</p>
