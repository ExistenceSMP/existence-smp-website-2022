	<h1>Existence SMP</h1>

	<p>
		Welcome to the Existence SMP Community! We're an Online Minecraft Community group established in
		March 2016.
	</p>

	<p>
		Over the past few years we've had 3 primary YouTube based series and are now focusing on
		creating a more open Minecraft community with our <a class="anchor" href="/server"
			>Community Server</a
		>
	</p>

	<h2>Our socials</h2>

	<h2>Community Server</h2>

	<p>
		Following the release of Minecraft 1.16, we have opened our <a class="anchor" href="/server">
			Community Server
		</a>!
	</p>

	<p>
		The Community Server is our whitelisted SMP for Patrons and Trusted members of the Existence
		Community
	</p>
	<p>
		Leading on from the sucsess of <a class="anchor" href="/server/keystone">Project Keystone</a>,
		the server is the home of Existence SMP for our new community-focused era
	</p>

		series, and 2 Project series

	<h2>Existence Podcast</h2>

	<p>
		The Existence Podcast has been running since the start of Existence SMP Season 2. It features
		monthly episodes hosted by Existence SMP members and a range of guests. We like to use the
		podcast to keep community members up to date with current happenings behind the scenes and often
		talk about the latest Minecraft news and more. Just a casul podcast to listen to while sitting
		back, relaxing, getting some work done or playing a bit of Minecraft.
	</p>

	<p>
